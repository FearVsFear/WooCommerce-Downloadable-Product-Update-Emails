== Description ==

A simple plugin used to send emails to customers who bought a downloadable product, letting them know that there's been an update to their download. Never let customers guess if an edition of the e-book they bought has been updated. No more need to manually email customers about downloadable product updates or creating a new product.

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Email sends as wordpress.example.com =

I used wp_mail in the plugin so you could easily override the default send from email using an SMTP plugin such as: https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/

= HTML Email Templates? =

Will be available in Pro version of plugin.

= What are Email Bursts? =

Used for setting the amount of emails addresses to grab and send emails to every time the scheduled time hits.

= What Happens if I set the email bursts amount to more than 10? =

In theory there should be no problem with this. But if you are on shared hosting it's recommended that you keep the bursts count at a decent amount.
