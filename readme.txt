= HTML Email Templates? =

Planned.

= What are Email Bursts? =

Used for setting the amount of emails addresses to grab and send emails to every time the scheduled time hits.

= What Happens if I set the email bursts amount to more than 10? =

In theory there should be no problem with this. But if you are on shared hosting it's recommended that you keep the bursts count at a decent amount.
