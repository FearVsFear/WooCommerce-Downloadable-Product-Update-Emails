A simple plugin used to send emails to customers who bought a downloadable product, letting them know that there's been an update to their download.

I Noticed that there's not a feature for this, or maybe I didn't look hard enough. But either way this is a plugin to add some basic functionality to your website.

<em>Better handling of emails</em><br />

<li>Currently emails are sent within a loop on post save if "I Updated The Download File" is checked, this behaviour will be changed to add a schedule event for each email.</li>
